# A place for useful TeX templates

## Who's it for

This place is for beginning users of TeX/LaTeX looking for a soft introduction to what is a wonderful software for creating great notes (books, articles, presentations....)

Maybe others can contribute any of the following:

* Useful code snippets (such as creating very simple graphs or flow diagrams)
* Links to useful resources such as guides
