# latex_note_template
A place for useful tex templates

I've decided to put tex template(s) in this repository, ones that people may find useful. 

It's not really for advanced users of LaTeX, rather it's more for people looking for a soft transition where they can begin to get results right away. I'll begin by putting one or two different versions of what I use to take notes with and maybe others can contribute the following:

* Useful code snippets
* Additional templates for different types of specialization
