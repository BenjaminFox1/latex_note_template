# A place for useful TeX templates

I've decided to put tex template(s) in this repository, ones that people may find useful.

My most basic assumption is that you have TeX, LaTeX installed together with some sort of editor.

So, **what the hell to do next?** 

# Who's it for

It's not for advanced users of TeX/LaTeX who have been copiously rewarded with links and resources. Rather, it's more for people looking for a soft transition so they can begin to get results right away. 

I'll begin by putting one or two different versions of what I use to take notes. Maybe others can contribute any of the following:

* Useful code snippets (such as creating very simple graphs or flow diagrams)
* Links to useful resources such as guides
