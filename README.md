# A place for useful TeX templates

I've decided to put tex template(s) in this repository, ones that people may find useful.

My most basic assumption is that you have TeX, LaTeX etc and some sort of editor installed but don't know **what the hell to do next.** 

# Who's it for
It's not really for advanced users of TeX/LaTeX. Rather, it's more for people looking for a soft transition so they can begin to get results right away. 

I'll begin by putting one or two different versions of what I use to take notes. Maybe others can contribute any of the following:

* Useful code snippets (such as creating very simple graphs or flow diagrams)
* Links to useful resources such as guides
